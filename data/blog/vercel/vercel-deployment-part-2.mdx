summary: 'As part 1 with Vercel and GitHub Actions, we have already known how to deploy a React app to Vercel. But, how can we separate the pipeline to multiple stages with GitHub Actions?'

Before getting with this session, if you don't know how to create a Vercel app and use it with GitHub Action. Please refer to [Deploy frontend application (React) to Vercel using Github Action - Part 1](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-1).

# Get started

Back to your React app at [Part 1](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-1), setup a new pipeline located at `.github/workflow/buildAndDeploy.yaml` as following.

We have 3 stages: **Setup**, **build** and **deploy** to make your Vercel application will be build and deploy independently.

## Setup:

- This stage will determine which is environment your application is going to be deployed (`preview` or `production`) by checking the `github.ref`. The environment will be stored in `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (an public variable from GitHub to store the output from step)
  - If `github.ref` is `refs/heads/master`, we can assign the pipeline would be used for `production` environment.
  - Otherwise, any `github.ref` is different from `refs/heads/master`, we will assign to `preview` environment.
- Then, we also checkout the source code from GitHub repository, pull the environment variables which belong to your target environment to prepare for the [build](#build) stage. The environment variable will be artifact to your GitHub by using [actions/upload-artifact@v4](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact)

```
setup:
  name: Setup
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    env: ${{ steps.check-target-deployment.outputs.env }}
  steps:
    - name: Check target deployment
      id: check-target-deployment
      run: |
        if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/master" ]]; then
          echo "env=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        else
          echo "env=preview" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        fi
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install Vercel CLI
      run: npm install --global vercel@latest

    - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
      run: |
        vercel pull --yes --environment=${{ steps.check-target-deployment.outputs.env }} \
          --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

    - name: List Vercel Environment Files
      run: ls -la .vercel

    - name: Upload Vercel Environment Files as Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: vercel-environment-files
        path: .vercel/
        include-hidden-files: true
```

## Build:

This stage will build your Vercel application by using GitHub Action. The environment (`preview` or `production`) and environment variables which are using in this stage will depend on [Setup](#setup), the environment (`preview` or `production`) and environment variables will depend on [Setup](#setup).

- The first step, we also need to checkout the source code from Git repository.
- Then, download the artifact which store at Setup step.
- Run `vercel build` with your **VERCEL_TOKEN** and target environment from **$GITHUB_OUTPUT**
- Artifact your build output to GitHub artifact

```
build:
  name: Build Vercel ${{ needs.setup.outputs.env  }} environment
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [setup]
  steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install Vercel CLI
      run: npm install --global vercel@latest

    - name: Download Vercel Environment Files
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: vercel-environment-files
        path: .vercel/

    - name: Build Project Artifacts
      run: vercel build --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --target=${{ needs.setup.outputs.env }}

    - name: List Build Output Files
      run: ls -la .vercel/output

    - name: Upload Build Artifacts
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: vercel-build-output
        path: .vercel/output
        include-hidden-files: true
```

## Deploy

At [build](#build) stage, we've already built and uploaded your output to artifact, and we also use the output from **$GITHUB_OUTPUT** at [setup](#setup) stage, then, this stage will be also depended on them. Now, let's see how **deploy** stage works with it.

```
deploy:
  name: Deploy to Vercel ${{ needs.setup.outputs.env || 'preview' }} environment
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [setup, build]
  steps:
    - name: Download Build Artifacts
      uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: vercel-build-output
        path: .vercel/output

    - name: List Build Output Files
      run: ls -la .vercel/output

    - name: Install Vercel CLI
      run: npm install --global vercel@latest

    - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
      run: |
        vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} \
          --target=${{ needs.setup.outputs.env || 'preview' }}
```

## You're done

The following is `buildAndDeploy.yaml` file by using 3 above stages. Additionally, I've limited the target branches which GitHub Action can be trigger if there are any push actions to `develop` and `master`. You can change to any branches you need.

```
name: Build and deploy to Vercel

env:
  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - develop
jobs:
  setup:
    name: Setup
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      env: ${{ steps.check-target-deployment.outputs.env }}
    steps:
      - name: Check target deployment
        id: check-target-deployment
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/master" ]]; then
            echo "env=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
            echo "env=preview" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi
      - name: Checkout Code

            --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

      - name: List Vercel Environment Files
        run: ls -la .vercel

      - name: Upload Vercel Environment Files as Artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: vercel-environment-files
          path: .vercel/
          include-hidden-files: true

  build:
    name: Build Vercel ${{ needs.setup.outputs.env  }} environment

      - name: Build Project Artifacts
        run: vercel build --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} --target=${{ needs.setup.outputs.env }}

      - name: List Build Output Files
        run: ls -la .vercel/output

      - name: Upload Build Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: vercel-build-output
          path: .vercel/output
          include-hidden-files: true

  deploy:
    name: Deploy to Vercel ${{ needs.setup.outputs.env || 'preview' }} environment
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [setup, build]
    steps:
      - name: Download Build Artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: vercel-build-output
          path: .vercel/output

      - name: List Build Output Files
        run: ls -la .vercel/output

      - name: Install Vercel CLI
        run: npm install --global vercel@latest

      - name: Deploy Project Artifacts to Vercel
        run: |
          vercel deploy --prebuilt --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }} \
            --target=${{ needs.setup.outputs.env || 'preview' }}
```

# Testing time

Let's try to push a new commit to your `master` branch, GitHub Action will trigger the pipeline and deploy to Vercel production.
![GitHub Action trigger production deployment](/static/images/blogs/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-2/github-action-vercel-deploy-production.png)

This is your time. Let's try to push a new commit to `develop` and see the preview action will be triggered.

# Conclusion

GitHub Action is a new modern CI/CD provider which can be easy to integrate with Vercel. If your applications need a custom build and deploy steps, this part is suitable for your cases.
