summary: 'As part 2 with Vercel and GitHub Actions, we have already known how to separate a single stage to multiple stages. But, how can we trigger the build an deploy manually?'

Before getting with this session, if you don't know how to create a Vercel app and use it with GitHub Action. Please refer to [Deploy frontend application (React) to Vercel using Github Action - Part 1](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-1) and [Deploy frontend application (React) to Vercel using Github Action - Part 2](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-2).

# Get started

In [part 2](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/vercel/vercel-deployment-part-2), we've already have a full `buildAndDeployment.yaml` file. Let's re-use it for this session as following.

- GitHub Action introduces `workflow_dispatch` to manually trigger the pipeline
```
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    env:
      description: 'Environment'
      required: true
      type: choice
      default: preview
      options: [ preview, production ]
```

- At this configuration, we have to define the `inputs` for the workflow. We only need to environment which we target to, then define `env` with a type `choice` to choose the velue from `options`. Don't forget to set `default` value is one of item in the `options`.
- GitHub Action automatic have branch dropdown within `workflow_dispatch` selection, you can choose the `branch` you need to build and deploy and the `env` from the `inputs`
- Next, let's update the Setup stage a little bit, focus on step `Check target deployment`
```
- name: Check target deployment
  id: check-target-deployment
  run: |
    echo "${{ github.event_name }}"
    if [[ "${{ github.event_name }}" == "workflow_dispatch" ]]; then
      echo "env=${{ github.event.inputs.env }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    elif [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/master" ]]; then
      echo "env=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    else
      echo "env=preview" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
    fi
```

- GitHub Action provide the `github.event_name` with have a lot of events from GitHub. In order to work with `workflow_dispatch`, we have to use `github.event_name` as `workflow_dispatch` and retrieve the `env` which we defined to store into the **$GITHUB_OUTPUT**
- The following is the fully of the **Setup** stage which includes both of automatic trigger by pushing the code to `develop` and `master` branches, and manually trigger the workflow by `workflow_dispatch`:

```
setup:
  name: Setup
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    env: ${{ steps.check-target-deployment.outputs.env }}
  steps:
    - name: Check target deployment
      id: check-target-deployment
      run: |
        echo "${{ github.event_name }}"
        if [[ "${{ github.event_name }}" == "workflow_dispatch" ]]; then
          echo "env=${{ github.event.inputs.env }}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        elif [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/master" ]]; then
          echo "env=production" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        else
          echo "env=preview" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        fi
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Install Vercel CLI
      run: npm install --global vercel@latest

    - name: Pull Vercel Environment Information
      run: |
        vercel pull --yes --environment=${{ steps.check-target-deployment.outputs.env }} \
          --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

    - name: List Vercel Environment Files
      run: ls -la .vercel

    - name: Upload Vercel Environment Files as Artifact
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: vercel-environment-files
        path: .vercel/
        include-hidden-files: true
```
- Adjust `buildAndDeployment.yaml` with new **Setup** stage. Pushing the changes to GitHub, release the changes to `master` and check the **Actions**. You will see the `workflow_dispatch` dropdown

# Testing time

This is your time to testing the manually build and deploy with `workflow_dispatch` event from GitHub. Choose the `branch` and `env`, then click `Run workflow`, and alert *This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger.* will be show as below:

# Conclusion

GitHub Action provide to us a lot of events which developers can use to trigger the pipeline, `workflow_dispatch` is one. Use `workflow_dispatch` to manually trigger the deployment if you would like to verify the build and deployment on any branches and environment you have.
