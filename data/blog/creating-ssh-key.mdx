summary: 'SSH key can be used to establish a secure connection with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or access to a remote server. So, how can we create a ssh-key on your MacOS?'

# 1. Check for existing SSH keys

You should check for existing SSH keys on your MacOS

Open Terminal and run the following:

```
cd ~/.ssh
```

- If you see "No such file or directory", then there aren't any existing keys. [Go to step 3](#create-a-new-key).
- Check to see if you have a key already:

```
ls id_*
```

- If there are existing keys, you can retrieve the ssh-key via open these files and use them to wherever you want (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket,...)

# 2. Back up old SSH keys

In case you've already have the key, but you would like to have a new one instead of use the old one, you should back those up.

Go back to your Terminal, at `.ssh` folder:

```
mkdir key_backups
cp id_* key_backups
```

# 3. Creating a new key

3.1. Open your Terminal and enter the following:

```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

**Note**: _If you're using a legacy system that doesn't support the ED25519 algorithm, use the below_:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Associating the key with your email address helps you to identify the key later on.

You'll see a response similar to this:

```
trung.nguyen@trungtmnguyen ~ % ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C trungntm.97@gmail.com
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_ed25519):
```

3.2. Just press `Enter` to accept the default location and file name. If the .ssh directory doesn't exist, the system creates one for you.

3.3. Enter, and re-enter, a passphrase when prompted.
The whole interaction will look similar to this:

```
trung.nguyen@trungtmnguyen ~ % ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C fperez@email.com
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:gTVWKbn41z6JgBNu3wYjLC4abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy trungntm.97@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|==+.    +o..     |
|.oE.   +o..      |
|    . ...o       |
|     .o...       |
|     oo+S  .     |
|  + ..B = . .    |
|.+.+.oo+ * o .   |
|o++.o+  . + +    |
|B+ o.    .   .   |
+----[SHA256]-----+
trung.nguyen@trungtmnguyen ~ %
```

3.4. You're done. You can use new ssh-key to configure on Git system, or remote server.
