# What is SDKMAN?

[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) (Software Development Kit Manager) is a tool for managing parallel versions of multiple Software Development Kits on most Unix-based systems. It provides a convenient Command Line Interface (CLI) and API for installing, switching, removing and listing candidates.

SDKMAN supports various JVM-based technologies including:

- **Java** (Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, GraalVM, etc.)
- **Gradle** - Build automation tool
- **Maven** - Project management tool
- **Kotlin** - JVM programming language
- **Scala** - Functional programming language
- **Spring Boot CLI** - Spring Boot command line interface
- And many more!

## Why Use SDKMAN?

### 🔄 **Version Management Made Easy**

Switch between different Java versions with a single command - perfect for projects requiring different JDK versions.

### 🚀 **Simple Installation Process**

No need to manually download, extract, and configure environment variables. SDKMAN handles everything.

### 🌍 **Cross-Platform Support**

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Git Bash).

### 📦 **Multiple Vendors Support**

Choose from various Java distributions like Oracle JDK, OpenJDK, Amazon Corretto, AdoptOpenJDK, and more.

# Prerequisites

Before installing SDKMAN, ensure your system meets these requirements:

## For SDKMAN Installation:

- [x] **Unix-based system** (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL/Git Bash)
- [x] **curl** or **wget** installed
- [x] **bash** shell (version 3.2+)

## For Installing Java/SDKs (after SDKMAN is installed):

- [x] **zip** and **unzip** utilities (needed to extract downloaded SDK archives)

You can verify these prerequisites by running:

```bash
# Check if curl is installed (required for SDKMAN installation)
curl --version

# Check bash version (required for SDKMAN)
bash --version

# Check if zip/unzip are available (needed later for SDK installations)
zip --version
unzip --version
```

# Installing SDKMAN

## Step 1: Install SDKMAN

Open your terminal and run the following command to install SDKMAN:

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

This command will:

- Download the SDKMAN installation script
- Install SDKMAN in your home directory (`~/.sdkman`)
- Add necessary configurations to your shell profile

## Step 2: Initialize SDKMAN

After installation, you need to initialize SDKMAN in your current terminal session:

```bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```

Alternatively, you can open a new terminal window, and SDKMAN will be automatically initialized.

## Step 3: Verify Installation

Confirm that SDKMAN is properly installed by checking its version:

```bash
sdk version
```

You should see output similar to:

```
SDKMAN!
script: 5.18.0
native: 0.4.6
```

# Installing Java with SDKMAN

Now that SDKMAN is installed, let's explore how to install and manage Java versions.

## List Available Java Versions

To see all available Java versions, use:

```bash
sdk list java
```

This will display a comprehensive list of available Java distributions and versions:

```
================================================================================
Available Java Versions for Linux 64bit
================================================================================
 Vendor        | Use | Version      | Dist    | Status     | Identifier
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Corretto      |     | 21.0.1       | amzn    |            | 21.0.1-amzn
               |     | 17.0.9       | amzn    |            | 17.0.9-amzn
               |     | 11.0.21      | amzn    |            | 11.0.21-amzn
               |     | 8.0.392      | amzn    |            | 8.0.392-amzn

               |     | 17.0.9       | open    |            | 17.0.9-open
               |     | 11.0.21      | open    |            | 11.0.21-open
               |     | 8.0.392      | open    |            | 8.0.392-open
 Oracle        |     | 21.0.1       | oracle  |            | 21.0.1-oracle
               |     | 17.0.9       | oracle  |            | 17.0.9-oracle
================================================================================
```

## Install a Java Version

To install a specific Java version, use the `install` command with the identifier:

```bash
# Install the latest LTS version (Java 21)
sdk install java 21.0.1-open

# Install Java 17 (Previous LTS)
sdk install java 17.0.9-open

# Install Java 11 (Another LTS version)
sdk install java 11.0.21-open

# Install Amazon Corretto 17
sdk install java 17.0.9-amzn
```

During installation, SDKMAN will ask if you want to set this version as the default. Type `Y` for yes or `N` for no.

## Install Latest Java Version

To install the latest available Java version without specifying the exact version number:

```bash
sdk install java
```

This will install the latest stable release and set it as your default Java version.

# Managing Java Versions

## Switch Between Java Versions

### Use a Specific Version for Current Session

```bash
sdk use java 17.0.9-open
```

This switches to Java 17 for the current terminal session only.

### Set Default Java Version

```bash
sdk default java 21.0.1-open
```

This sets Java 21 as the default version for all new terminal sessions.

## List Installed Java Versions

To see all Java versions installed on your system:

```bash
sdk list java | grep installed
```

Or use:

```bash
sdk current java
```

This shows the currently active Java version.

## Verify Java Installation

After installing or switching Java versions, verify the installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

You should see output indicating the correct Java version and JAVA_HOME path.

Additionally, you can manual setup your JAVA_HOME on `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:

```
export JAVA_HOME=${SDKMAN_CANDIDATES_DIR}/java/${CURRENT}
```

# Advanced SDKMAN Features

## Environment Configuration

SDKMAN automatically sets the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable when you switch Java versions. You can verify this:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
# Output: /Users/username/.sdkman/candidates/java/current
```

## Uninstall Java Versions

To remove a Java version you no longer need:

```bash
sdk uninstall java 11.0.21-open
```

## Update SDKMAN

Keep SDKMAN up to date with:

```bash
sdk update
```

## Flush Archives and Temp Files

Clean up downloaded archives and temporary files:

```bash
sdk flush archives
sdk flush temp
```

# Project-Specific Java Versions

## Using .sdkmanrc File

You can create a `.sdkmanrc` file in your project root to specify the Java version for that project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create .sdkmanrc file
echo "java=17.0.9-open" > .sdkmanrc

# Enable auto-switching (one-time setup)
sdk config
# Set sdkman_auto_env=true
```

Now, whenever you `cd` into the project directory, SDKMAN will automatically switch to the specified Java version.

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Issue 1: Command Not Found

If you get "sdk: command not found" error:

```bash
# Check if SDKMAN is properly sourced
echo $SDKMAN_DIR

# If empty, manually source SDKMAN
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

# Add to your shell profile permanently
echo 'source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"' >> ~/.bashrc
# or for zsh users
echo 'source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Issue 2: Permission Denied

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
# Check SDKMAN directory permissions
ls -la ~/.sdkman

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod -R 755 ~/.sdkman
```

## Issue 3: Network Issues

If downloads fail due to network issues:

```bash
# Set proxy if needed
export http_proxy=http://your-proxy:port
export https_proxy=https://your-proxy:port

# Or configure SDKMAN with different mirror
sdk config
```

# Best Practices

## 1. Keep LTS Versions

Install and maintain Long Term Support (LTS) versions for stability:

- Java 8 (LTS until 2030)
- Java 11 (LTS until 2026)
- Java 17 (LTS until 2029)
- Java 21 (LTS until 2031)

## 2. Use Project-Specific Versions

Create `.sdkmanrc` files for projects to ensure team consistency:

```bash
# Example .sdkmanrc for a Spring Boot project
java=17.0.9-open
gradle=8.4
maven=3.9.5
```

## 3. Regular Updates

Keep your Java installations updated:

```bash
# Update SDKMAN itself
sdk update

# Check for newer versions
sdk list java

# Upgrade to newer patch versions
sdk install java 21.0.2-open
sdk default java 21.0.2-open
sdk uninstall java 21.0.1-open
```

## 4. Clean Up Regularly

Remove unused versions to save disk space:

```bash
# List installed versions
sdk list java | grep installed

# Remove old versions
sdk uninstall java 8.0.382-open

# Clean up archives
sdk flush archives
```
