If you do not have any idea to generate the `ssh-key`, please refer to [creating-ssh-key](https://trungtmnguyen.com/blog/creating-ssh-key).

# Introduction

In the case I have multiple `ssh-key` and would like to use them for specified Git repo. In stead of backup them and manual update `.ssh` directory, I prefer to have an automation shell script to help with that.

# Get started

Take a look at your `.ssh` directory.

- I will create a new directory named `trungntm` - which will store the `ssh-key` for user trungntm
- I also create a new one named `developer1` - which will store the `ssh-key` for user developer1
- Next step, you need to manual move your `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` into new folders. _Note: you should check correct files before moving them to ensure right files will be used_
- Okay, at this step, you've already have the enough files into your new folders. Let's open your `.bash_profile` and update it as below:

```
cd ~
vi .bash_profile
```

Update the `shell` function into your `.bash_profile`. _Don't forget to update your user directory on your machine_

```
function use-ssh() {
        echo "ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ Switching to ssh profile " $1
        cp /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/$1/id_rsa.$1 /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_rsa
        cp /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/$1/id_rsa.pub.$1 /Users/trung.nguyen/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        echo "Completed ðŸ”¥ âœ…"
}
```

- Saving them, and open new Terminal and trying new `use-ssh` command:

```
use-ssh trungntm
```

The command will be called and update the `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` to main files in `.ssh` folder will similar to this:

```
trung.nguyen@trungtmnguyen ~ % use-ssh trungntm
ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ Switching to ssh profile  trungntm
Completed ðŸ”¥ âœ…
```

Let's try to switch to developer1

```
trung.nguyen@trungtmnguyen ~ % use-ssh developer1
ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ Switching to ssh profile  developer1
Completed ðŸ”¥ âœ…
```

You're done. Now, you can create a multiple profiles and switch between them easily via shell command.

_Happy coding!_
