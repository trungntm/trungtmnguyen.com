# 💡 How to Use Postman Scratch Pad Without Workspace

Starting from **Postman v10.18** (released around **May 2023**), the classic **Scratch Pad** mode was officially **removed** and replaced by a new **workspace-based experience** that requires users to **sign in**.
While this transition aims to improve collaboration and syncing between devices, many developers still prefer a **lightweight**, **offline**, and **no-login** workflow.

If you’re one of them — here’s a simple trick to **re-enable the Scratch Pad manually**, even in the latest versions of Postman.

# ⚙️ Steps to Enable Scratch Pad

Follow these 7 simple steps:

1. **Run Postman** — make sure it starts in the **lightweight client** mode (the default for new versions).
2. **Open DevTools** — press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on macOS).
3. In the **Console**, run this command:

   ```
   pm.settings.setSetting("offlineAPIClientEnabled", 0)
   ```

   This disables the lightweight client and switches Postman back to the **Scratch Pad** mode.

4. **Restart Postman** — you’ll briefly see the Scratch Pad interface appear before it gets hidden by the login screen.
5. **Open DevTools again** (same shortcut as before).
6. Run this command in the console:

   ```
   pm.mediator.trigger("hideUserSwitchingExperienceModal")
   ```

7. 🎉 **Done!** You now have full access to **Scratch Pad** again — no login, no workspace required.

# 🧠 Why This Works

These commands toggle Postman’s internal feature flags that control how the **workspace UI** and **offline mode** are displayed.
Essentially, you’re telling Postman to behave like an older version, where **Scratch Pad** was the default.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- This tweak might **reset after Postman updates**, so keep the steps handy.
- It’s meant for **personal or offline testing only** — avoid using it for team workspaces or production setups.
- The commands are safe; they simply modify client-side settings.

# ✅ Final Thoughts

Postman’s move to enforce sign-in and cloud workspaces makes sense for collaboration —
but sometimes, developers just want the **simplicity of offline Scratch Pad**.

This little trick gives you back that flexibility. Happy testing! 🚀
